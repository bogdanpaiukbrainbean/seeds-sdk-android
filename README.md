##What's Countly?
[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics application. 
It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application 
usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, 
and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.
